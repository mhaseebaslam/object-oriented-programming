## Exercise 1: Basic Average Calculation

### Objective

Write a simple program to find the average of five numbers without using any functions.

### Instructions

1. Create separate variables to store each of the five numbers.
2. Create another variable to store the sum of these numbers.
3. Create a variable to store the count of numbers (which is 5 in this case).
4. Calculate the average using the formula: `average = sum / count`.
5. Display the average to the user.

## Exercise 2: Basic Average Calculation Expanded

### Objective

Modify the solution from Exercise 1 to use an array of 10 numbers instead of separate variables.

### Instructions

1. Create an array that contains 10 numbers.
2. Calculate the sum of the numbers in the array.
3. Find the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array (which is 10).
4. Display the average to the user.

## Exercise 3: Calculate Average GPA of a Student

### Objective

Calculate the average GPA (Grade Point Average) of a student based on their course grades.

### Instructions

1. Use the following course grades:
    - Introduction to Programming â€“ 5
    - Computer Devices â€“ 3
    - Engineering English â€“ 4
    - Object-Oriented Programming â€“ 2
    - Mathematics Primer â€“ 4
2. Calculate the sum of these grades.
3. Find the average GPA by dividing the sum by the number of courses (which is 5).
4. Display the average GPA to the user.

## Exercise 4: Average Calculator Function

### Objective

Create a function that calculates the average of an array of numbers.

### Instructions

1. Write a function named `calculateAverage` that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter.
2. Inside the function, calculate the sum of the numbers in the array.
3. Divide the sum by the number of elements in the array to find the average.
4. Return the average from the function.
5. Test the function with different arrays to ensure it works correctly.

## Exercise 5: Calculate GPA Averages of Three Students

### Objective

Calculate the average GPA of three students using the function created in Exercise 4.

### Instructions

1. Store the course grades for three students: Joe, Lisa, and Max.
2. Use the `calculateAverage` function to find the average GPA for each student.
3. Print the grades and the calculated GPA of each student to the console.

## How to Use
