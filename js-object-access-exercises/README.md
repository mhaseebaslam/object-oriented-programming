## Exercise 1: Accessing Object Properties

**Objective:**
Access and print the properties of a given JavaScript object.

**Instructions:**

1. Create an object `person` with the properties:
    - `name`: "John Doe"
    - `age`: 30
    - `city`: "New York"
2. Access and print each property of the object using dot notation.
3. Access and print each property of the object using bracket notation.

## Exercise 2: Nested Objects

**Objective:**
Access properties from a nested object.

**Instructions:**

1. Create an object `company` with the properties:
    - `name`: "TechCorp"
    - `location`: "San Francisco"
    - `employeesCount`: 100
    - `details`: { `CEO`: "Jane Smith", `CTO`: "Mike Brown" }
2. Access and print the name of the company.
3. Access and print the number of employees.
4. Access and print the name of the CTO.

## Exercise 3: Updating Object Properties

**Objective:**
Update the properties of an object.

**Instructions:**

1. Create an object `car` with the properties:
    - `make`: "Toyota"
    - `model`: "Camry"
    - `year`: 2019
2. Update the `year` property to 2021.
3. Add a new property `color` with the value "blue".
4. Delete the `model` property from the object.
5. Print the updated object to verify changes.

## Exercise 4: Looping Through Object Properties

**Objective:**
Use a loop to iterate over object properties.

**Instructions:**

1. Create an object `student` with the properties:
    - `name`: "Alice"
    - `grade`: "A"
    - `subject`: "Mathematics"
    - `year`: "Sophomore"
2. Write a function that takes an object as an argument and uses a `for...in` loop to print each key and its corresponding value.
3. Call the function with the `student` object to test it.

## Exercise 5: Accessing Properties with Variables

**Objective:**
Access object properties using variables.

**Instructions:**

1. Create an object `book` with the properties:
    - `title`: "The Great Gatsby"
    - `author`: "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
    - `year`: 1925
2. Create a variable `property` and assign it the string "author".
3. Access and print the value of the `author` property using the variable `property`.
4. Change the value of the `property` variable to "title" and access and print the value of the `title` property.
