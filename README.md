## What is This Repository About?

This repository is designed to help you learn **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in JavaScript, which is a powerful way to create interactive web pages. OOP allows you to organize your code into reusable pieces called **objects**. By working through these exercises, you will learn how to:

- **Create Classes and Objects**: Understand how to define and use classes and objects in JavaScript.
- **Work with the DOM**: Manipulate the **Document Object Model (DOM)** using OOP principles.
- **Handle User Actions**: Respond to user interactions, such as clicks and inputs, using OOP techniques.
- **Build Interactive Projects**: Develop small, interactive projects that run in the browser.
